Request Resource: http://localhost:12345/myapi/bookPrice/102

Step1: Send the Request to Authorizarion Server with the following URL to Get
the Userâ€™s Permission
A) Eendpoint - /oauth/authorize
B) Query Parameters
 - client_id,
 - redirect_uri,
 - response_type,
 - scope 

Hit below url and enter Resource Owner username and password from properties file , authorize the request and get the Authorizarion code
http://localhost:12345/oauth/authorize?client_id=satishapp&redirect_uri=http://localhost:5000/callback&response_type=code&scope=read_profile

This code randomly generated by the Authorization Server which must be used by the client to request for an access token ,This is called Grant code which is given by Resource Owner
http://localhost:5000/callback?code=FpQMsh


Step 2: Send the POST Request to Authorizarion Server with the following to
get an access token using the previously received Authorization Code
A) Eendpoint - /oauth/ token
B) Query Parameters
 - clientId,
 - clientSecrect
 - code received
 - redirect_uri,
 - grant_type,
 - scope
curl -X POST http://localhost:12345/oauth/token --user satishapp:satish123 -H "content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "code=FpQMsh&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:5000/callback&scope=read_profile"

Run the above curl command and get the access token:
{
"access_token":"b22e00e7-61cf-46c9-8cdb-28279c68f437",
"token_type":"bearer",
"expires_in":43199,
"scope":"read_profile"
}


Step 3: Now access the BookPrice by providing the retrieved access
You can now Invoke your Resources or REST API with the Access Token received
above.
curl -X GET http://localhost:12345/myapi/bookPrice/105 -H "authorization:Bearer b22e00e7-61cf-46c9-8cdb-28279c68f437" 

if access token is valid or not expired , then we are able to access the resoruce api like below

Output: {"bookId":105,"bookName":"Spring Microservices","price":540.0}
